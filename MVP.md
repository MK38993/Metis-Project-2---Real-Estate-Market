# Metis Project 2: New York Housing Market

### Estimating housing prices in New York City

The goal of this project is to understand which factor are most important in predicting housing prices in New York City.

To achieve this goal, I ran a linear regression model to describe a property's sale price as a function of its size in square feet.

The data show a weak correlation between the two values. However, as square footage increases, the model's residuals increase rapidly as well, demonstrating that the price of a property is greatly affected by a number of other factors as well.
