# Metis Project 2: Housing Market - PROPOSAL
 
### Question/need:
Since COVID lockdowns began, many people have begun to work remotely, removing the need for them to live near New York City. As a result, many workers have moved away from the city. This analysis will attempt to predict housing prices with a regression model.

### Data Description:
I'll be predicting housing prices in New York City by scraping sold house listings between June 2020-Present. Each listing should include sale price, location, square footage, number of floors, bedrooms, bathrooms, and year built.



### Tools:
I plan to use Python's Requests library to scrape real-estate listings, BeautifulSoup to obtain listing data.

Pandas, NumPy and ScikitLearn will be useful in organizing and analyzing the data.
